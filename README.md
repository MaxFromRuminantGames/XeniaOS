# XeniaOS
I liked the DIY nature of Arch linux, and I liked the source focused nature of gentoo. This is meant to be the best of both worlds, the kernel is meant to be as modular as humanly possible, the only programs included are vim, make, gcc, and git, everything else needs to be compiled from source.

As much as I'd like to claim the name comes from the Greek philosophy of hospitality and is in reference to the OS's goal to be as hospitable for individual devices and different program architectures (I plan on adding native support for both elf and windows executables) or something smart like that, in reality I thought it was a pretty name when I was early in my transition and yoinked it from that one 90's transfem linux fursona :3.

I'm going to be blatantly honest, the source code is going to look ugly, I've tried to make it look nicer by using concepts such as functional or data oriented programming, but when it comes to kernel development, some things are just going to be ugly; also I'm not the best at programming, my main passions are music and game dev, so there will probably be quite a few spots where my lack of experience shows. Feel free to fork this and either clean up the code, or inject even worse code into it, I licensed it under creative commons for a reason.
